How To Destroy Resources
*************************
In order to delete the resources we created for each folder ``lke`` and for ``dns`` just cd into that folder and replace the ``apply`` command with ``destroy`` using the same vars file.

This will go out and destroy your resources, do it per folder ``lke`` and ``dns``.
